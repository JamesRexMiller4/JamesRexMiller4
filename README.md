### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is James Miller, and welcome to my Github profile. I am currently working at Invoca, a marketing SaaS company, where I am refactoring legacy code written in
Rails and Backbone.js into GraphQL endpoints and React components. In my spare time I am diving deeper into computer science fundamentals (data structures and algorithms) because I find it interesting, and who knows maybe it will be useful one day ðŸ™ƒ. Other than that I am focusing on becoming the best version of myself as I can be, and enjoy helping others become their fully realized selves.

## Look around
Personally, I am most proud of my project Condensate. There is still much to be done before that baby is fully realized, but you should check out some of my Github favorites as I think these are some of the most interesting open source repos on the webs.
