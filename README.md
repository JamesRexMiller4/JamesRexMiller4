### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my profile! I am a developer primarily skilled in JavaScript/React, CSS/SCSS, HTML, OOP, and TDD. Currently working on bettering my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and currently seeking new opportunities ðŸ˜‰. Other than that I am focusing on becoming the best version of myself as I can be, and enjoy helping others become their fully realized selves.

## Look around
Personally, I am most proud of my project Condensate. There is still much to be done before that baby is fully realized, but you should check out some of my Github favorites as I think these are some of the most interesting open source repos on the webs.
