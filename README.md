### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is James Miller, and welcome to my Github profile. I am currently working at Invoca, a marketing SaaS company, where I am refactoring legacy code written in
Rails and Backbone.js into GraphQL endpoints and React components. In my spare time I am diving deeper in to computer science fundamentals (data structures and algorithms) because I find it interesting, and who knows maybe it will be useful one day ðŸ™ƒ. Other than that I am just focusing on becoming the best version of myself as I can be, and enjoy helping others becoming their fully realized selves.

## Good to knows
- Fuck racism
- Fuck bias
- Be a good person

## Look around
Personally, I am most proud of my project Condensate. But there is still much to be done before that baby is fully realized, but you should check out some of my Github favorites as I think these are some of the most interesting open source repos on the webs.
